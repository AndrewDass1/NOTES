Python Notes: <br>
<br>
High-level language - high-level data types such as arrays and dictionaries <br>
<br>
Modules: <br>
I/O <br>
System Calls <br>
Sockets <br>
Interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like TK <br>
<br>
An interpreted language - Save you considerable time during program development because no complilation and linking is necessary <br>
<br>
<br>

Chapter 2: <br>
Interpreter - Program that converts the code a developer writes into an 
intermediate language, called byte code. It converts the code line by line, one at a 
time. It translates till the end and stops at that line where an error occurs, if any,
making the debugging process easy <br>

<br>
Python is an interpreted language <br>
<br>
Argument passing, use import sys to see what has been declared <br>
Sys is a python module that uses commands that interacts with the interpreter <br>
<br>

Steps: <br>
Source code -> Interpreter (Compiler + PVM - python virtual machine) converts intermediate code to bytecode <br>
Compiler converts the source code for PVM <br>
PVM reads and executes the commands <br>

Source code encoding - UTF-8 <br>

# -> Comments <br>
+ -> addition <br>
- -> subtraction <br>
/ -> division <br>
// -> floor division <br>
* -> multiplication <br>
<br>
round(variable, 2) <br>
2 - placeholder for decimal places <br>
<br>
' \' ' = single quote or " ' " <br>
<br>
\" \" = double quote <br>
<br>

r'' <br>

Lists: <br>
<br>
Indexing: <br>
variable_name[position] <br>
<br>
indexing : [starting:ending], ex: ending = 7, goes to 6th value <br>
Always goes to position before end <br>
<br>
<br>

Concatenate: list1 + list2 <br>
<br>
.append() method <br>
<br>
len() <br>
<br>
Nested Lists: <br>
list3 = [list1, list2] <br>
<br>
list3[0][1] - get new position <br>
<br>
new line - \n <br>
