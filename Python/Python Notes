Chapter 1
Python Notes: 

High-level language - high-level data types such as arrays and dictionaries

Modules:
I/O
System Calls
Sockets
Interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like TK

An interpreted language - Save you considerable time during program development because no
complilation and linking is necessary



Chapter 2:
Interpreter - Program that converts the code a developer writes into an 
intermediate language, called byte code. It converts the code line by line, one at a 
time. It translates till the end and stops at that line where an error occurs, if any,
making the debugging process easy

Python is an interpreted language

Argument passing, use import sys to see what has been declared
Sys is a python module that uses commands that interacts with the interpreter


Steps:
Source code -> Interpreter (Compiler + PVM - python virtual machine) converts intermediate code 
to bytecode
Compiler converts the source code for PVM
PVM reads and executes the commands


>>> - Interactive mode

Source code encoding - UTF-8

Chapter 3
# -> Comments
+ -> addition
- -> subtraction
/ -> division
// -> floor division
* -> multiplication

round(variable, 2)
2 - placeholder for decimal places

' \' ' = single quote or " ' "

\" \" = double quote


r''

Lists:

Indexing:
variable_name[position]

indexing : [starting:ending], ex: ending = 7, goes to 6th value
Always goes to position before end



Concatenate: list1 + list2

.append() method

len()

Nested Lists:
list3 = [list1, list2]

list3[0][1] - get new position

new line - \n
